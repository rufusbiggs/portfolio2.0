                <p>
                Driven and detail-oriented, I have a track record of delivering innovative software products. 
                  With a background as a Business Analyst in a fintech startup, Iâ€™ve expanded my technical expertise
                  through hands-on development and problem-solving projects. I am now eager to apply my analytical 
                  skills and technical knowledge to something new. Ideally in a collaborative team and working on 
                  meaningful projects. Checkout some of my own personal projects below!
